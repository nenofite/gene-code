# Genetic Algorithm to Write Programs

This is a small project for fun and to build experience with Rust.
The plan is:

1. Create a very simple stack-based language (i.e. a drastically simplified version of Forth)
2. Create a genetic algorithm to generate, mutate, and select small sequences of code in this stack-based language
3. Run the genetic algorithm and see if it can evolve a few simple programs (e.g. add two numbers, compute a hypotenuse)
4. Add more power to the stack-based language (i.e. branching, variables)
5. Run the genetic algorithm to see if it can evelove a few more interesting programs (e.g. compute the nth Fibonacci number, sort three numbers)

This project is also an exercise in test-driven design.
